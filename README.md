# Typewriter Toy

A typewriter toy written in TS based on this [this YouTube page - Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWD0EJgBlYQ)

## Setup

Created using Vite as mentioned in the video

```sh
$ npm create vite@latest
$ cd typewriter-toy
$ npm add -D vite-plugin-checker
```

## Running

```sh
$ npm install

$ npm run dev

# or run with make

$ make dev

```

## Notes

Promises abound! - see colour() vs colour2()

The code needs a little refactoring :)
